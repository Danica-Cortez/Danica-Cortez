# 🙋🏽‍♀️ Hey there

I'm Danica, a data professional with a deep passion for storytelling through data. I'm currently working on unsupervised clustering analysis.

⚡Fun fact: I am an avid traveler and have explored over 20 countries. My favorite thing about traveling, besides getting to experience different ways of being, is trying different cuisines.
